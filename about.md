Hi all,

I'm Hoang-Anh Dao, a Vietnamese current residing in Japan (a proud Kyotoite but had moved to Mie for work T-T). I'm an inspired crystallographer-wanna-be but was continously humiliated and harassed by my supervisor so I dropped PhD, started working part-time at [Torikizoku (鳥貴族)][Torikizoku (鳥貴族)] before landing a job in a small pharmaceutical company. I think that is why I'm still finding ways to regain my confidence, having my identity crisis unresolved and love life wrecked. Fortunately, I always have the supports I didn't deserve from my friends to work my way to get back things that I deserved. So yay me!

I make this blog (?) to save stuffs that I've been learning recently (also to serve as an archive of things that I often have to look up). I hope these posts would be helpful to anyone who pursuing structural biology, crystallography, or just need some light readings on how I'm doing. Hope that help :3

This site is power by [Jekyll][jekyll-page]. Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight java %}
public class Test { 
  public static void main(String args[]) { 
      System.out.println("Good luck you all <3"); 
  } 
} 
{% endhighlight %}

Love you all <3
